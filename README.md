# Good day! üëã

‚õ∫Ô∏è I am Chen Punak. a **.NET Developer**. You can call me Chen for short.

I am a developer with 2 years of experience in .NET with a little bit of ReactJS, Angular.
I started my working life in 2022 in a company that manufactures and distributes medical solutions such as Smart OPD systems. We developed desktop apps to work with medical devices such as blood pressure monitors, height monitors, etc. to be a Smart system.
And in 2023, I had the opportunity to work as an Outsource with ITD at the GFP site, which helped support the improvement of the document management system and fix various system errors that customers requested

I started as a web developer with .NET family of tools and have become very proficient in this framework. I am more comfortable with back-end work than front-end work and of course I can do both. I can use EntityFramework, SQL Server and write StoredProcedure, have knowledge of OOP concept and SDLC as well.

Currently, I am studying various front-end tools to apply and increase my knowledge and understanding of this work. Even though I don't really like front-end work, I will overcome it to become a great developer.
